//Abstract base contract, representing a generic passenger vetting scheme.
//Currently, these are government agencies (for example, TSA)
//In the future, this vetting could be performed by airports, private organizations, or tie
//into some form of decentralized web of trust.
//At any rate, the intent is to provide some degree of assurance that
//travel booked by any given contract holder is tied to the identity of a traveller that does not pose
//a security risk

//Blockchain has unique technical advantages for vetting, because
//agencies can issue, revoke, and otherwise manage traveller profiles in a computational secure way
